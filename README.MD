# Usage:

## Code Examples:

```java
import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.Command;
import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.CommandBase;
import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.CommandResult;
import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.JDACommand;
import net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDA;
import net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder;
import net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.MessageChannel;

public class YourClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JDA jda = new JDABuilder.create("token").build;
        JDACommand command = new JDACommand("prefix", jda);
        command.registerCommandsInPackage("your.package.commands");
    }
}

//in package your.package.commands
public class YourCommandClass extends CommandBase {
    @Command(name = "hello", description = "Responds with \"Hello World!\"")
    public CommandResult execute(String[] args, CommandEvent event, User author, Member member, Guild guild, MessageChannel channel) {
        channel.sendMessage("Hello World!").queue();
        return CommandResult.SUCCESS;
    }
    //you can also have multiple command handlers in one class!
    @Command(name = "cooldown",description = "Demonstration on how the cooldown works!",cooldown = 10) //cooldown of 10 seconds
    public CommandResult executeCooldown(String[] args, CommandEvent event, User author, Member member, Guild guild, MessageChannel channel) {
        channel.sendMessage("Hello World!").queue();
        return CommandResult.SUCCESS;
    }
}

public class YourCommandClass1 extends CommandBase {
    @Command(name = "hello1", description = "Responds with \"Hello World!\"")
    public CommandResult execute(String[] args, CommandEvent event, User author, Member member, Guild guild, MessageChannel channel) {
        channel.sendMessage("Hello World! (1)").queue();
        return CommandResult.SUCCESS;
    }
}

public class YourCommandClass2 extends CommandBase {
    @Command(name = "hello2", description = "Responds with \"Hello World!\"")
    public CommandResult execute(String[] args, CommandEvent event, User author, Member member, Guild guild, MessageChannel channel) {
        channel.sendMessage("Hello World! (2)").queue();
        return CommandResult.SUCCESS;
    }
}
```
### OR:

You can do this:

```java
import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.Command;
import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.CommandBase;

import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.JDACommand;
import net.badbird5907.jdacommand.CommandType;
import net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDA;
import net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder;
import net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.MessageChannel;

public class YourClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JDA jda = new JDABuilder.create("token").build;
        JDACommand command = new JDACommand("prefix", jda);
        command.registerCommand(new YourCommandClass());
    }
}

public class YourCommandClass extends CommandBase {
    @Command(name = "hello", description = "Responds with \"Hello World!\"",commandType = CommandType.FUN)
    public CommandResult execute(String[] args, CommandEvent event, User author, Member member, Guild guild, MessageChannel channel) {
